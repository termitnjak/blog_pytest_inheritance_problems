# Pytest inheritance problems

This is the code to go with the [Pytest inheritance problems blog post](http://www.termitnjak.com/en/blog/pytest-inheritance-problems). To try it out, you need to have pytest installed

```bash
virtualenv . --python python3
source bin/activate
pip install pytest
```

Then go to the directory you want (`src/humans` or `src/presidents`) and run

```bash
py.test
```

to run the tests.
